	self lessonDescription: 'Now try cloning your mouse! You can use "self cloneMouse" for that. The cloned mouse will spawn right above the other mouse. So dont worry if you only see one mouse after that because there are two mouses overlapping each other. The new mouse can be called with "mouse2" and the old mouse with "mouse". Now move your new "mouse2" to the plattform to allow the first mouse to get to the finishing target. Good luck!'
